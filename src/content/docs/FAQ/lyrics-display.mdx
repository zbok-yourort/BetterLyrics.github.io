### Incorrect lyrics displayed (Mismatch)

- Please go to `Settings` -> `Playback Sources` -> `Lyrics Search Strategy` and select `Best Match`.

  > Note: For each song, the first time using Best Match will take about 10 seconds. Please be patient.

- Or open the lyrics search window to manually search for the correct lyrics.

> The lyrics search window can be opened in one of the following ways:
>
> - Move the mouse to the lower area of the window until the bottom control bar appears, then click the magnifying glass icon (🔍) on the bottom right to open the search window.
> - Right-click the software icon in the system tray and select "Open Lyrics Window".

### Lyrics keep moving back and forth (Timeline jumping)

Go to `Settings` > `Playback Sources` > Disable `Lyrics Timeline Sync` or increase the `Lyrics Timeline Sync Threshold`.

### How to set up local lyrics sources?

**Step 1: Add Folder**
Go to `Settings` -> `Media Library`, click the `Add` button, add the folder where you store lyrics (or music files containing embedded lyrics), and ensure the switch on the right is set to **"On"**.

**Step 2: Prepare Files**
The software supports two methods:

1.  **External Lyrics Files (.lrc/.eslrc/.ttml)**
    When comparing, the software **does not distinguish word order** and **automatically ignores punctuation**.
    - **Recommended Naming:** `Artist - Title.lrc`
    - **Also Supports:** `Title Artist.lrc`
    - **Also Supports:** `Title (Live) - Artist.lrc`
    - _Example: When playing Taylor Swift's "Love Story", the filename `love_story_taylor_swift.lrc` can also be accurately identified._

2.  **Embedded Lyrics**
    If lyrics are already written into the tags of your local music files (.mp3/.flac, etc.), the software will also automatically read them.

> We recommend the following ways to check music file tag information:
>
> - [Music Tag](https://www.cnblogs.com/vinlxc/p/11347744.html): Browse local song metadata.
> - If **Step 1: Add Folder** is completed, go to the BetterLyrics `Music Library` and click the three dots icon (···) on the right of a music entry to show parsed metadata (may differ from actual info).

> To ensure smooth matching for the **Embedded Lyrics** method, the following tools are recommended:
>
> - [Music Tag](https://www.cnblogs.com/vinlxc/p/11347744.html): Batch write **all metadata** into local music file tags.
> - [LDDC](https://github.com/chenmozhijin/LDDC): Batch write **verbatim lyrics** into local music file tags.

### Partial garbled text in lyrics

This is usually a default font setting issue. Go to `Settings` -> `Lyrics Window Management` -> `Lyrics Style` -> `Lyrics Font` -> Type `Arial` to get the most stable display effect.
