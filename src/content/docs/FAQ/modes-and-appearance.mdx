### How to add more modes?

The software has initially added all preset modes for you.

You can import window status files shared by others: Go to `Settings` -> `Lyrics Window Management` -> Import (Down Arrow Icon) -> Select the file to import (`.json` format).

> To export window status, right-click the window status and select `Export`.

### How to switch modes?

- Press the default shortcut `Ctrl + Alt + S`, then select the mode displayed on the screen to switch. (Press `Esc` to close the selection window).
- Find the double-headed arrow icon in the top-left area of the lyrics window and click it to summon the lyrics window switcher.
