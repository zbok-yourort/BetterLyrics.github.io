title: Welcome to BetterLyrics
---

**An elegant and deeply customizable lyrics visualizer & versatile music player, built with WinUI3/Win2D.**

**This welcome page is designed to help users quickly identify and resolve common issues:**

BetterLyrics relies entirely on the Windows **System Media Transport Controls (SMTC)** protocol to function.

## 🛠️ Quick Troubleshooting

If BetterLyrics is not displaying lyrics after launch, or if the text/progress is incorrect, please follow these self-check steps:

### 1️⃣ Step One: Check the Playback Source
**Is your music player reporting its status to Windows SMTC?**

* **Desktop Clients (QQ Music, NetEase Cloud Music, etc.)**:
    * Many players require [additional configuration](/player-cfg). Please ensure you have installed the corresponding plugins or adjusted the player settings according to the instructions.

### 2️⃣ Step Two: Check Software Settings
**Is BetterLyrics ignoring the application?**

* Go to BetterLyrics **Settings** -> **Playback Source**.
* Check if your player's name is in the source list and ensure the option to "Listen to new playback sources" is enabled.
