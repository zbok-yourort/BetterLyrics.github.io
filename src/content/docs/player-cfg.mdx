> This section summarizes the mainstream players supported by BetterLyrics along with their configuration guides. Please select your specific player from the list on the left for details.

## Core Mechanism

BetterLyrics primarily retrieves playback information via the **[System Media Transport Controls (SMTC)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/audio-video-camera/integrate-with-systemmediatransportcontrols)**. Depending on the integration level, players generally fall into two categories:

### 1. Out of the Box (Native SMTC Support)
Modern players that fully integrate with **SMTC** typically require **no configuration** and work immediately.
* **Includes**: Spotify, Apple Music, Media Player (New), Chrome/Edge browsers, etc.

### 2. Configuration Required (Plugins/Settings)
Some legacy players or heavily customized software require **installing specific plugins** or **enabling specific settings** to expose playback information.
* **Includes**: AIMP, foobar2000, NetEase Cloud Music, QQ Music, etc.
