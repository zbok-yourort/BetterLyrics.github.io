## Setup Guide

**No configuration required**. This player natively supports System Media Transport Controls (SMTC). Simply start playback to use.

### Specialized Optimizations

Despite Apple Music's native SMTC support, BetterLyrics includes **specialized adaptations** for it:

* **Metadata Formatting**: Automatically cleans raw transmission data to accurately separate song titles from artist names.
* **Timeline Stabilization**: Addresses the instability of Apple Music's timeline data with built-in **compensation presets**, effectively eliminating progress jumps to ensure smooth lyric scrolling.
